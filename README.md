# Python Project Template

Start point for a python package/app

I didn't include JetBrain's config folder here since it will create a new one when opening the new project.

## Usage

1. Create repo using this template
2. clone the repo to local machine for dev
3. create new venv under the project dir
4. using pip to install project dir as editable
